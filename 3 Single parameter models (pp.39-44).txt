#the goal is to estimate variance (sigma^2)
#nonnformative prior density is proportional to 1/sigma^2
#this is assigned to the variance
#the technique is to define precision parameter P=1/sigma^2
#P is distributed as U/v, where U has a chi-squared distribution with n degrees of freedom
#we are interested in a point estimate with 95% probability interval

# d is the difference variable

d=favorite-underdog-spread

# n is the sample size

n=length(d)

# v is the sum of squares of differences

v=sum(d^2)

#We simulate 1000 values from the posterior distribution 
#of the standard deviation in 2 steps
#Step 1: simulate values of the precision parameter P from the scaled chi-square(n)

p=rchisq(1000,n)/v

#Step 2: Peform transformation

s=sqrt(1/p)

#quantile command is used to extract the 2.5%, 50%, and 97.5%
#percentiles of this simulated sample
#A point estimate for sigma is the posterior median (50%)
#The 95%probability bounds are given by 2.5% and 97.5%

#Estimating a heart transplant mortality rate (lambda)
#estimate rate of success of hearth transplant
#n is number of surgeries
#y is number of deaths within 30 days
#standard MLE is Poisson distribution but this is poor when deaths is close to zero
#in thiss situation we use prior gamma(alpha, beta)
#Source of prior information is heart transplant data from a small group of hospitals
#that we believe has the same rate of mortality as the rate from the hospital of interest.
#Suppose we observe number of deaths z(j) and exposure o(j) for ten hospitals (j=1,...10)
#z(j) is poisson 
#standard non-informative prior for lambda is proportional to 1/lambda
#prior distribution is then gamma(alpha = summation of z(j), beta = summation of o(j))
#or gamma(16, 15174)
#posterior is gamma(alpha+y(obs), Beta+exposure)
#y(obs) and exposure are the observed data

#model checking
#y(obs) = 1 only and exposure = 66

#we use dpois and dgamma to get (prior) predictive distibution
#prior mean value was used to ensure no "underflow" in computaions

#dgamma in numerator is prior
#dgamma in denominator is posterior
